# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for POST requests.  The `bug.js` file showcases a vulnerable POST route that doesn't handle cases where the request body is missing or contains invalid data.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, illustrating best practices for securing and making your Express.js applications more resilient.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (assuming you have Node.js and npm installed).
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` without a request body or with an invalid JSON body.
5. Observe the unexpected behavior (e.g., crash or silent failure).
